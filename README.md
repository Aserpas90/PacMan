# PACMAN

## [DESCRIPTION]

This is a simple project showcasing some entry-level design using Javascript and HTML. What you should see is a PacMan eat his way across the screen and bounce off of the walls.

## [HOW TO RUN]
First clone this repository and then open the index.html file

## [FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS]

Add a vertical axis to make it more similar to the real PacMan
